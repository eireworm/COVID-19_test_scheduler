<p>A COVID-19 Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) test is the most reliable COVID-19 test available because it looks at 
the genetic material of the virus. It is done in a lab and is a very reliable way of knowing if you are currently infected with COVID-19.
The HSE is a public service body for the government of Ireland.</p>
<br>
<p>You should order a COVID-19 PCR test if you have been asked to by a GP or you are experiencing one or more of the following symtoms:</p>
<br>
<ul style="list-style-type:disc; margin-left: 100px;">
    <li>&#8226; Constant cough</li>
    <li>&#8226; High temperature (38 degrees Celsius or above)</li>
    <li>&#8226; Loss of taste or smell</li>
</ul>
<br>
<p>You must still self isolate for 14 days if your RT-PCR test results do not detect COVID-19</p>
