    <p>A COVID-19 Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) test is the most reliable COVID-19 test available because it looks at the genetic material of the virus. It is done in a lab and is a very reliable way of knowing if you are currently infected with COVID-19.</p>
    <br>
    <p>You should order a COVID-19 PCR test if you have been asked to by a GP or you are experiencing one or more of the following symtoms:</p>
    <br>
    <ul style="list-style-type:disc; margin-left: 100px;">
        <li>&#8226; Constant cough</li>
        <li>&#8226; High temperature (38 degrees Celsius or above)</li>
        <li>&#8226; Loss of taste or smell</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <p>You must still self isolate for 14 days if your RT-PCR test results do not detects COVID-19</p>
